Hi,

The print files are now v. 2.1 - these files are done based on the redesign in Fusion360 by Nate.
There are slight modifications as we have now created a base for the sensor which adds some sturdiness and accuracy of the mounting of the actual sensor.

Please print the base, the correct lid and finally the tray for the sensor.
See instructions for the specifications of the switch.
If you are planning to power the device of the USB port via a USB-C power source choose the lid without a switch.

There is also a parametric design for fusion360 available for download in case you want to make modifications.
We do not recommend making changes to the sensor distance etc. as this would impact calibration.

The bottom is the same for both designs.

No Supports
Filament: PLA
