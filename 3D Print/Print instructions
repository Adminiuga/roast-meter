These files are universar for use with both a battery or none.
Currently the size of the case is made for a battery which is 20MM wide and 35mm long, however upon request I will add more.

No Supports
Filament: PLA
Nozzle Size 0.4
Layer height: 0.2

There are two options of the top part

One with screws and one with taps.
The benefit with the screws one is that you can easily open the case. 

The case with taps may look better, but you will most likely not be able to take it apart without breakting the taps, requiring a reprint of both base and top.
