Hi,

The print files are now syncronized with the latest usable versions of the case design from https://github.com/PatrickFrN/roast-meter/ 
These files are done based on the redesign in Fusion360 by Nate but maintained by PatrickN
There are slight modifications as we have now created a base for the sensor which adds some sturdiness and accuracy of the mounting of the actual sensor.

The full roast meter requires you to print 3 parts:
1: The base, which holds the artemis board and battery (Optional)
2: The lid - You can choose a lid with room for a switch and one which does not have a switch.
- If you choose not to install a battery and power via USB-C port then you will choose the lid without switch
3: The Sensor Tray, used to mount and keep the MAX30101 sensor in place

Please print the base, the correct lid and finally the tray for the sensor.
See instructions for the specifications of the switch.
If you are planning to power the device of the USB port via a USB-C power source choose the lid without a switch.

There is also a parametric design for fusion360 available for download in case you want to make modifications.
We do not recommend making changes to the sensor distance etc. as this would impact calibration.

The bottom is the same for both designs.
