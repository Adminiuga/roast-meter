Hi,

The print files are now v. 2.0 - these files are done based on the redesign in Fusion360 by Nate.
Functionally the same, but of course much prettier.

If you are planning on building the version with a battery there is a version with a switch. See instructions for the specifications of the switch.

If you are planning to power the device of the USB port via a battery or other power source choose the lid without a switch.

The bottom is the same for both designs.
